That player is safe from elimination by any means that night. The chosen player must cannot be the same player twice in a row, but the same player may be chosen multiple times per game. The Moderator does not point out to the Bodyguard who is going to be eliminated that night. Finally, the Bodyguard cannot protect himself.[]", impact: 3, priority: 52, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [.Protection], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "bodyguard"), isNightActiveRole: .NightActiveRole)

If all living players in the game are part of the cult, the Cult Leader wins.", roleExplanation: "The Cult Leader wakes up every night and points to a person that will join the cult. All players that are part of the cult do not know they are part of the cult - just like in real life! Even though he appears as a villager, the Cult Leader only wins if all players left in the game are part of the cult. Other teams may still fulfill victory contidions.

Eros wakes up during the first night and points at two players. He may choose himself, as one of the two players. The Moderator then wakes up the two lovebirds the first night by tapping them on the shoulder so they can see who the other sweetheart is. If either of the lovers is eliminated, for any reason, the other is also eliminated instantly, because of a broken heart.\n\nThe lovers fall under a few special victory conditions. If both lovers are on the village team, they win with the village team. Similarly, ff they are both on the werewolf team, they win with the werewolf team. However, if the two lovers find themselves on different teams, they relinquish all other ties, become their own team, and only win if they are the last two players in the game. Being a Lovebird overrides all other winning conditions.[]", impact: -3, priority: 76, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [.Lovestruck], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "cupid"), isNightActiveRole: .NotNightActiveRole)

They start the game on the village team and they act for the benefit of the village. That is, unless they are targeted for elimination by the werewolves, at which point they then join the werewolf team instead of being eliminated.\n\nEvery night, the Moderator should wake the Cursed to let them know if they have switched teams. Once the Cursed has switched teams, the Moderator should continue to call the role, so the players do not know he has been changed.).[]", impact: -3, priority: 5, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "cursed"), isNightActiveRole: .NightActiveRole)

Every night afterwards, the Werewolves must agree (only a majority is needed, and need not be unanimous) on a target to eliminate. If the Werewolves spend more than the alloted time determining a target for the night, they do not get to choose a target that night. The Werewolves may not target another Werewolf at night, unless the Leprechaun is in play.[]", impact: -6, priority: 25, team: [.TeamWerewolf], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "werewolf"), isNightActiveRole: .NightActiveRole)

The Phantom will watch each night round and, for the first ten rounds, will provide a single letter clue, as a message from beyond to the village. There are a few limitations: the Phantom may not attempt to identify any player by name or initials. The Phantom should try to be as helpful as possible with their clues, but, must try and remain calm if people are mis-interpreting their clues.[]", impact: 2, priority: 1, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "ghost"), isNightActiveRole: .NotNightActiveRole)

He will choose another player to be his target, and that player is also eliminated. The Huntsman may also choose to die nobly, if he doesn't suspect anyone, and fire his weapon in the air, resulting in no additional elimination. No one may speak while the Huntsman chooses a target. If eliminated at night, the Huntsman chooses his target first thing in the morning.[]", impact: 3, priority: 61, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "hunter"), isNightActiveRole: .NotNightActiveRole)

Regular adjanceny rules apply with the expection that if a player next to to the Insomniac is eliminated at night, he is informed about that player's actions and not the player next to the eliminated player.[]", impact: 3, priority: 199, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "insomniac"), isNightActiveRole: .NightActiveRole)

let LYCAN = Role(name: "Lycan", type: .Lycan, description: "You are a Villager, but appear to the Seer as a Werewolf.", roleExplanation: "The Lycan is a villager of questionable parentage. Turns out, people were right to be slightly suspicios as the Lycan has a dormant drain of werewolfism, and appears to be a werewolf to the Seer even though she's not.[]", impact: -1, priority: 205, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "lycan"), isNightActiveRole: .NotNightActiveRole)

Starting on the first day, no one in the village may directly or indirectly speak of the Masons. There are two penalties for players that speak of them: the first person to speak of the Masons is visited by the Masons at night and is silenced... for the rest of the game! Any players that mention the Masons afterwards are eliminated that night by the secret society in order to keep it a secret. If they are eliminated by the secret society, they automatically lose, even if they are on a winning team.\n\nImportant notes for the Moderator: use discretion. It's much better for gameplay if the subject is never discussed directly or indirectly by the players.

If the player next to the Thing is eliminated, the Thing may tap the next player over. But each night, he must tap one of his neighbours (even if his original neighbours are eliminated).\n\nThe good 'thing' about the Thing is that if he is sitting next to players on the village team, they know they can trust him. However, if he is sitting next to even one Werewolf, itâs probably in the werewolvesâ best interest to kill him off quickly, because otherwise heâll be compelled to 'defend' the Thing during the day in order not to raise suspicion upon himself.\n\nNo other players may tap or touch anyone else during the Thingâs 'awakening' or at any other time during the night.[]", impact: 3, priority: 157, team: [.TeamVillage], availableEffects: [], image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "theThing"), isNightActiveRole: .NightActiveRole)
