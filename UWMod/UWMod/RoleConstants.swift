They might try to secretly let the Seer know that they are a Villager on their team, but if a Werewolf finds out, it could be disastrous for the village team.\n\n[The Beholder is a street urchin that, daily, struggles to survive in the village. Despite his destitute situation, no-one in the village pays attention to him, which makes him a perfect spy. Perchance, he, one day, accidentally saw something he wasn't supposed to see and now knows the secret identity of the Seer.]",

The chosen player cannot be the same player twice in a row, but the same player may be chosen multiple times per game. The Moderator does not point out to the Bodyguard who is going to be eliminated that night. Finally, the Bodyguard cannot protect himself.\n\n[Once a mercenary, the Bodyguard settled in the Village wanting to leave constantly travelling behind him. He now makes a living by selling his protection services to anyone in the village that is willing to hire him. His unwavering trust in his shield has not, so far, let him down.]",

All players that are part of the cult do not know they are part of the cult - just like in real life! Even though he appears as a villager, the Cult Leader only wins if all players left in the game are part of the cult. Other teams may still fulfill victory contidions. The Cult Leader does not need to be alive to win.\n\n[Plagued by disturbing dreams, this former farmer began to preach to anyone that would listen. Slowly, over time, more and more people began to pay attention and joined the secret gatherings he held while he promised them a utopian paradise on earth. If only the others realized that they had become cultists in his fevered scheme.]",

                 roleExplanation: "Eros wakes up during the first night and points at two players. He may choose himself, as one of the two players. The Moderator then wakes up the two lovebirds the first night by tapping them on the shoulder so they can see who the other sweetheart is. Eros should have closed their eyes by this point in time, if not one of the two lovers. If either of the lovers is eliminated, for any reason, the other is also eliminated instantly.\n\nThe lovers fall under a few special victory conditions. If both lovers are on the village team, they win with the village team. Similarly, ff they are both on the werewolf team, they win with the werewolf team. However, if the two lovers find themselves on different teams, they relinquish all other ties, become their own team, and only win if they are the last two players in the game. Being a Lovebird overrides all other winning conditions.\n\n[The god-child Eros has assumed human disguise and walks, hidden, amongst the villagers. Though thought long extinct, these possessive walkabouts greatly amused the ethereal gods, until, of course, people became suspicious of the posessed and decided to do something about it. However, Eros was a simple being, whose pleasure lay in making others fall, dangerously, in love. To the point that if one of the lovers died, the other would literally drop of heartbreak.]",

                  roleExplanation: "The Cursed starts the game on the village team and they act for the benefit of the village. That is, unless they are targeted for elimination by the werewolves, at which point they then join the werewolf team instead of being eliminated. Every night, the Moderator should wake the Cursed to let them know if they have switched teams. Once the Cursed has switched teams, the Moderator should continue to call the role, so the players do not know he has been changed.).\n\n[His family had long been cursed, it had been said. Of course, no-one took these sorts of things seriously. Ancient curses were just stories, after all, told to childern to quiet them at night. Little did any villager know that this curse was bound by blood and bone and was as real as the Old Man's arthiritis. Hopefully, the werewolves don't attack him, for if they do, the villagers not only lose a trusted member of their community, but their enemiens grow in numbers.]",

Every night afterwards, the Werewolves must agree (only a majority is needed, and the victim need not be unanimously selected) on a target to eliminate. If the Werewolves spend more than the alloted time determining a target for the night, they do not get to choose a target that night. The Werewolves may not target another Werewolf at night, unless the Leprechaun is in play.\n\n[No-one knows where the Werewolves come from. Some say they are as old as fear itself, born of the terror of human's early days. Whatever their origin, one thing is for sure: they are an unwanted, violent predator. The best hope for people to survive this sudden onslaught, is to band together, figure out who to trust, and lynch the werewolves once and for all.]",

If the game does not have role reveal, the werewolves still pick a target the following night, but that target is not eliminated.\n\n[Sick and bedridden with some unidentified disease that is wreaking havock upon his body, this villager seems to be an easy target for the werewolves.

Furthermore, she doesnât wake up in the night with her fellow pack until another werewolf is eliminated. The other werewolves donât know who she is until she awakes with them at night. The Seer sees the Dreamwolf as a werewolf from the beginning of the game.\n\n[Spelled by an enchantress in the forest, the Dreamwolf is trapped in a deep sleep that can only be broken by the smell of a fellow werewolves' spilled blood. And so she sleeps, unbeknownst to anyone in the village. Woe to the village if they kill a werewolf and awaken her wrath.]",

The Phantom will watch each night round and, for the first ten rounds, will provide a single letter clue, as a message from beyond to the village. There are a few limitations: the Phantom may not attempt to identify any player by name or initials. The Phantom should try to be as helpful as possible with their clues, but, must try and remain calm if people are mis-interpreting their clues.\n\n[An old woman, loved by her family friends, passes away in the night.

If eliminated at night, the Huntsman chooses his target first thing in the morning.\n\n[His legend preceeded him as he rode into the village and everyone instantly recognized the Huntsman as he sat astride his horse. Hired by the town's mayor to help kill the werewolves, the Huntsman knows that paranoia and fear can often lead a town astray, causing suspicion where there should be none.
